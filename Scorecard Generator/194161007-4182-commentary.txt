4182~1~Rubel Hossain to Rahul, OUT, GONE! No century here for Rahul, as he looks to slash away a ball that was a touch too full for the shot he was looking to play. Takes the outer edge - may have been a change of pace too - and drops away to Mushfiqur Rahim's right. He takes a good catch low down to his right. It's not Rahul's most fluent innings in international cricket, but the volume of runs should do his confidence a world of good. He was in control for a greater percentage while his partnership with Rohit Sharma was on, incidentally

Mosaddek settled 15 yards in from the rope at deep backward square but produces a shaky effort reaching forward at neck height with palms facing out and fingers pointed up.

Kohli takes 10+ seconds before calling for DRS. Looked like it was missing leg live. Will be very hard to overturn with Shami coming around the stumps. There's also some doubt as to whether Soumya has sandwiched this off an inside edge into his pads. Third umpire Aleem Dar deems there has in fact been an inside edge and doesn't even proceed past Ultraedge onto ball-tracking.

4182~2~Sure enough the post-DRS TV replays with balltracking show it would have been umpire's call clipping the outside of leg stump. The difference is though that because Umpire Dar determined there was an inside edge, India lose their review instead of retaining it.

4182~2~
4182~2~Regardless of how you interpreted an inside edge or not, it was a very risky/speculative review just on the height and line angling down leg. There was little chance of it being three reds. A poor review by Kohli when taking that into consideration and they get burned losing the review on Dar's interpretation of an edge.

Very poor ball, short and wide angled across on sixth stump and going wider, sat up for Soumya to crank anywhere he wanted. He didn't keep it on the ground and didn't get the elevation either though. Kohli is standing 17 yards away on one of the used pitches on the square and latches onto this with a bunny hop reaching up at head height to his right. 7/10 on degree of difficulty coming at speed and at short range but a sitter for the Indian captain's standards.

Mosaddek wanted to run this with an open face down to third man but he's a touch out in front of the ball not accounting for the change of pace and the ball caroms off the inside bottom edge back onto the stumps.

Fullish length at 122 kph, offcutter angled into middle and leg stump, Shakib was backing away to create room but couldn't keep his hands back enough to wait for the pace off the ball, checks his shot and the ball balloons off somewhat of a leading edge toward Karthik on the ring at extra cover. He takes three steps in and pouches the catch at thigh height. Bangladesh's semi-final hopes have been submarined by Hardik in this chase.
