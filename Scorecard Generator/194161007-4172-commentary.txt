4172~1~Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Liton Das, OUT, full on off, drives in the air to short cover and Afghanistan are claiming a catch! Watching live I thought it definitely short hopped and Liton is standing his ground. Hashmatullah Shahidi is the fielder. It's 50/50. He lunged forward and the ball lodged in his right hand with his left hand coming off. His head was up high, didn't look at the ball going in to protect his face so he may genuinely not have known if it carried or not. And the third umpire has decided it is OUT! Third umpire is Aleem Dar. The soft signal on field was out and he said he didn't see anything conclusive to overturn on the mic'd up conversation. Those kinds of catches are regularly overturned. It'll generate plenty of debate for sure. It looked awkward at any rate as both hands were not under the ball, just the right one.

4172~1~Mohammad Nabi to Shakib Al Hasan, 1 wide, wicked shahp turn! So wicked in fact that it spins past the guidelines outside off, wide called.
4172~1~Sadman Hasan: "More often than not, the field umpires are not in a position to confirm a clean catch such as Liton's one. The way it looked, even the fielder could have little idea whether or not he completed the catch clean. Why not let the third umpire decide completely by himself? it absolutely makes no sense at all. Inconclusive evidence should favour the batting team; I thought that's the rule? I am pretty sure if it hadn't been for that soft signal, it would not have been given out by Dar."

Has it done enough to miss leg? The stump is half visible on the early replay...and tracking says it is clipping it. Umpire's call. Bangladesh retain their review, but they've lost Sarkar - who already looked quite lost at No. 5. Liton was probably pushed up today to counter Mujeeb, and we've seen why

Mushfiqur wasn't going to risk selling himself out for a partner on one leg. Shinwari fields in the ring and spins to fire wildly past the stumps with Mahmudullah well in. The line of the throw makes it impossible for a back-up fielder to be in position and they steal an overthrow.

4172~1~Rashid Khan to Mosaddek Hossain, 2 runs, full on off, tries to flick through midwicket again with no fielders in the on side ring, leading edge balloons toward extra cover, Gulbadin slow to react running forward, lunges as the ball lands short and goes under him for a pair. Microcosm of Afghanistan's fielding all day. Consistently a step too slow.

4172~1~Dawlat Zadran to Mushfiqur Rahim, OUT, Mushfiqur's superb effort ends with a skier to Nabi at extra cover! It was in the slot full outside off, just got under it way too much trying to clear the off side ring. Goes high to Nabi backpedaling from the circle and he takes it safely. Mushfiqur has set up Bangladesh beautifully on a track offering plenty of turn. Every run valuable on what is expected to be a tough chasing track used for a second match.

4172~1~Gulbadin Naib to Mohammad Saifuddin, 1 run, dropped! Frankly embarrassing from Dawlat. The same man who dropped Eoin Morgan on 26 on the boundary off Rashid in the England match produces the worst effort of the day - and there are plenty to choose from across these 50 overs. Gorgeous slower ball from Gulbadin landing wide outside off is sliced softly in the air to backward point. Dawlat runs to his right in front of Asghar moving left from short third man. He spills a dolly at head height. 2/10 on degree of difficulty.

4172~2~Mosaddek Hossain to Hashmatullah Shahidi, no run, should've been a runout! Hashmatullah chopped a short ball well wide of cover for what should have been an easy run after the ball was only partially knocked down by Liton Das at extra cover and squirted well away for a run. Both he and Gulbadin stopped midpitch to admire the scenery on the boundary. Mehidy backs up the misfield from point with Gulbadin still halfway down the pitch after Hashmatullah ran back. But he rushed the throw to Mosaddek over the stumps and dragged him two yards away to reprieve Gulbadin. An accurate relay would have had him out by 3 yards. Mosaddek is furious at Mehidy.

He got the itch again tempted out with a well flighted ball that was dragged slightly back and slightly wider on a fifth stump line. Hashmatullah doesn't cover the line and is beaten by the turn. Sharp work by Mushfiqur to whip the bails off with Hashmatullah's back foot flailing about three inches short of getting back in.

Shakib erupts, as does the partisan Bangladesh crowd! 8/10 on degree of difficulty due to the pace it came at Liton from short range but it was straight to him on line.

4172~2~Shagun Segan : "We all love the Afganistan team and the whole story about their fight and grit. But then you cant help but think which other team would have been a better prospect for this WC? Also wouldnt it make more sense to have the qualifiers in the host country, so that we know which is the best team to play in these conditions? Playing in Africa and qualifying for UK just seems wrong. It can work for sports that are not dependent on the field, but for cricket you need to play the team for the pitch." Certainly looked peculiar at the time to have the 2018 Qualifier in Zimbabwe, particularly considering that the 2014 World Cup Qualifier was held in New Zealand.

He shuffles back and forth side to side across the crease as Shakib approached this time and finally stopped moving with his feet outside leg stump as Shakib floated one full on middle. Asghar goes for the slog sweep as a release shot in frustration, too much elevation and not enough distance. Basic catch taken at waist height 8 yards in from the rope.
