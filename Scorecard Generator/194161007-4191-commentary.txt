4191~1~Archer to Finch, OUT, Ooooooh, Finch has been given out lbw by umpire Dharmasena. Finch reckons he has snicked it? Finch has a word with Warner and challenges the on-field out decision. Archer begins with a full inswinger, Finch is very vulnerable to it, particularly early in his innings. Starts outside off and nips back in towards middle, Finch gets too far across, plays around his front pad, much like how Kohli did yesterday v Boult, and is struck on the flap of the front pad. This is cannoning into middle stump. The tracker returns three reads and off you go for a golden duck in the semi-final, Finch

Replays suggest Roy did not touch it. England have lost their review and Roy has to go. He's seething, but umpire Erasmus chats with him and sends him off. He throws his gloves in the change room
