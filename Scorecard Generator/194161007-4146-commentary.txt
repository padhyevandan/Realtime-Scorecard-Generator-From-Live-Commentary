4146~1~Starc to Mohammad Shahzad, OUT, bowled him. Or has he! They're checking the front foot with the third umpire. It was very full on the stumps. Starc could see off the previous ball that Shahzad's footwork wasn't engaged this early and he got this one to swing in but this time on the middle stump line. Shahzad was late trying to stab it out playing slightly across the line. The front foot is deemed to be just okay in the end. Super start for Starc.

Same line and length as the previous ball from Stoinis full on fourth stump, but this time Nabi opens the face on his drive to try to squeeze it through the covers. Smith takes a step left before diving full extension to knock it down with his left hand. Nabi set off without hesitation believing he placed it wide enough for a safe run. But Smith, the puma in the ring! Gulbadin never left more than a few yards from the non-striker's end seeing Smith's effort but Nabi is so far down that Smith has time to get up off his knees and deliver a firm throw to Carey at head height on his way to the stumps and knocks the bails off with Nabi three yards short scampering back in vain.

Najib had little idea about it and by the time he was trying to fend it and sway out at the same time, the ball had already hit his bat high on the shoulder and sailed over slips to the boundary

4146~1~Stoinis to Gulbadin Naib, OUT, oh he's thrown it away. Short ball outside off and he wanted to fetch the pull from there to midwicket. Doesn't come off and the ball just zooms up in the air and towards where short leg would have been. Carey runs forward and settles under it. Crucial wicket, at a crucial time. Clever bowling by Stoinis, he bowled it slower which meant Naib couldn't get the timing right.

Elsewhere established teams are still not able to get it together on similar conditions. Thoroughly inspiring."

4146~2~Hamid Hassan to Finch, FOUR runs, full on fifth stump line, Finch reaches out to drive away from his body without much footwork. Thick edge flies past slip. Really needed three slips in there to have any hope of going to hand. Third man on the rope is very square and it beats him easily to the rope.

4146~2~Dawlat Zadran to Warner, 1 no ball, inexplicable overstep. Cummins did the same thing with his first ball of the match in the second over and now Dawlat matches him with a strange mental lapse. How do you not have your run-up correct at the start of your spell? Fullish length ball that Warner shoulders arms to but it doesn't count as part of the over.

4146~2~Mujeeb gets yanked after two very tame overs. Dawlat Zadran enters the attack with more fast-medium pace. One slip in bowling over the stumps to the lefty Warner.

Warner was squared up by a peach from Hamid angled across fourth stump line, he fended at it and a thick edge flew low to Rahmat Shah's left, looked like he got a hand/fingertips to it but hardly enough to slow it down before going to the rope. Had a second slip been in place, he would have snapped it up with ease.

And speak of the devil, here comes back No. 66, the greatest in my eyes since Mario Lemieux. If you don't know who that is, google is your friend. Over the stumps to Warner.

4146~2~Dawlat Zadran to Warner, 2 runs, direct hit would've nailed Smith coming back for the second! Short of a length ball on the legs and clipped behind square, Rashid charges in from long leg to cut off a second run and fires for the non-striker's end where Smith is struggling badly. Dawlat stood mid-pitch never bothering to get back over the stumps while Zazai was slow moving to cover the stumps from mid-off as well. Double-lapse not covering the relay or else the bails could've been knocked off easily. Dawlat gestures at Zazai upset at him for not covering but he is as much to blame.
