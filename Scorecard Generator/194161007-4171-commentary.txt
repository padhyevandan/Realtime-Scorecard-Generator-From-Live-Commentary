Short ball right in Fakhar's arc, and he smashed it straight to deep square. Soft signal not out. Given not out! Umpire doesn't have the evidence to overturn it

Therefore an infield judgement is required. In the case of stumpings or run outs the video evidence is cocnclusive." Requiring the umpires to take a guess seems unwise to me

Let's see what we have here - replays show no inside-edge, pitching outside off, hitting on middle, but going over leg stump! Great call from the umpire and South Africa lose their review.

The seamers have taken 53 wickets at 31.3 here in that time, the spinners 22 wickets at 36.3 (and an economy of 5.6). So it might spin a little, but the seamers are usually the ones who make the difference here.

If the ball pitched outside leg, will it be considered pitched outside off considering that the batsman changed to right-handed stance while attempting the shot?" -- Since de Kock did not change his grip (like in a switch-hit), he will be considered left-handed. If he changed his grip like Warner or Maxwell, then he'd be considered as a right-hander for lbws.

4171~2~Wahab Riaz to Miller, 1 run, full, on off, and punched down the ground. Wahab can't stop it, and that means they can scamper across for one

4171~2~Shadab Khan to Miller, no run, lbw appeal, and given! Miller reviews. This was full on middle, and turning across Miller. He misses the sweep, and ball hits front leg. But was it spinning too much? Replays say that it hit him in front of middle stump, but there's a thin under-edge. Miller survives!

4171~2~Shaheen Shah Afridi to Miller, OUT, slower delivery, and it does Miller. It's probably done South Africa in the process! Rolled his fingers over it, and Miller was looking to open up the offside. The ball clips the top of middle and leg, dismantling the stumps

In all aspects of the game, school cricket is a better quality than what these Proteas could ever think of producing!!!!!" Strong sentiments from Proteas' fans, and this is one of the milder ones.

4171~2~Wahab Riaz to Ngidi, OUT, he is now. Length ball this time which moved away, perhaps off the seam. Ngidi's bat nowhere near the line of its trajectory, and Pakistan are one wicket away

4171~2~Wahab Riaz to Imran Tahir, 1 run, what was going on there? Imran Tahir blocked, and just set off like a man who had determined he would not be facing one more ball from Wahab than necessary, Direct hit would have been curtains
4171~2~Shoaib: "What are the chances of getting into semis for Pak? It seems like NZ AUS has been qualified IND will .. is it race between ENG and Pak??" It's much more complicated than that, but if any team wants to get in from the outside, England are the likeliest ones to drop out. Mind you, not very likely, still. Would be a massive surprise

4171~2~Wahab Riaz to Imran Tahir, no run, gets his bat on that one, straight to mid-on. Last ball of Wahab's spell. Will it be the last ball of this contest?

4171~2~Wahab Riaz to Imran Tahir, no run, nearly. Nearly. Came back over the wicket, but Imran just about got the outside of his bat to it

4171~2~Mohammad Amir to Phehlukwayo, 2 runs, spanked down the ground from Phehlukwayo. Comes back for two, and that brings up South Africa's 250

4171~2~Mohammad Amir to Phehlukwayo, 2 runs, didn't middle that at all, but the edge was thick enough to take it square of third man, and they come back for a couple

4171~2~Mohammad Amir to Phehlukwayo, 2 runs, top edge. Shaheen Afridi never quite charged at it like he might have done. Is that a run out? They've gone upstairs. No it's not. Carry on

4171~2~Mohammad Amir to Phehlukwayo, FOUR runs, driven through the covers. This one was middled nicely, and a sloppy attempt on the boundary by Fakhar means South Africa get a four

4171~2~Mohammad Amir to Phehlukwayo, no run, rapped on the foot. Right, can Andile get his half-century. Needs a six ti make it happen

4171~2~1
4171~2~Mohammad Amir to Phehlukwayo, 1 run, full and on the stumps. Phehlukwayo tonks it down to cow corner, but there's a fielder there this time. Pakistan have won by 49 runs, and are very much alive in this World Cup
