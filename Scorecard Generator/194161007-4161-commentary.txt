4161~1~Meanwhile, this is what the law says on running on the pitch: *Bowler running on protected area* It is unfair for a bowler to enter the protected area in his/her follow-through without reasonable cause, whether or not the ball is delivered. If, in that innings, the same bowler contravenes this Law a third time, the umpire shall direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling.

On the other hand, Aamir will now be under immense pressure to avoid another warning and may not be able to deliver as planned..." But early for all this, I think. There's rain to come, and DLS very likely to play a part.

4161~1~2.30pm The hover cover is coming off. We aren't far from a resumption. The umpires are checking a few patches inside the 30-yard circle. The stumps have been put in too. Full game. On. Start at 2.40pm. Mid-innings break of 15 minutes. No overs lost.

4161~1~More reading, fun reading. We asked a selection of former cricketers, writers and senior journalists to pick their favourites from the opposition camp. You may or may not come out surprised.

4161~1~Here's a clip of Kohli's innings for readers in India, from Hotstar. Reckon he can make a dash towards a century when play resumes?

4161~1~2.10pm The square covers are being peeled off. Only the covers on the 22-yards and the run-ups on either side remain. The floodlights are starting to take effect.

Humorous and Entertaining. Keep up the good work." -- Thank you. Readers like you make us what we are.

4161~1~2.06pm Thanks, Danyal. Rain dance? What's that. I live in the era of the Naagin dance. The rain is easing off. We shouldn't be far from a resumption. The sun has decided to make another guest appearance.
4161~1~
4161~1~One way for Rohit fans - or just cricket fans - (in India) to pass the rain break: watch highlights of his innings, on Hotstar
4161~1~
4161~1~Right, to do the rain dance, now, here's Shashank.
4161~1~
4161~1~For all of you wondering, if Pakistan have a 20-over chase, the target will be 184
4161~1~
4161~1~Omkar: "If India don't get to bat again how much has Dhoni's wicket cost India?" Not much, it would appear. With Dhoni, the target would have been 328 in 46 for Pakistan.
4161~1~
4161~1~So if India don't bat again, Pakistan will have to chase 327 in 46 overs. That's all for later, however.
4161~1~
4161~1~Behram Ishfaq: "How heavy is the rain? Is it pouring or is it just some light drizzle?" It's a drizzle, but it's expected to get heavier at some point. We're supposed to have dry spells, to, though. So let's wait and see
4161~1~
4161~1~and the players are walking off. The rain has arrived!
4161~1~
4161~1~So while India bossed this innings, perhaps the rain came at just the wrong time for Pakistan, who would have had ideas about curtailing India below 330.
4161~1~
4161~1~Anshit: "Can they take innings break's time gap right now just like in tests, tea or lunch is taken early because of rain?" They could, but we don't start losing overs for another 75 minutes

4161~1~Ribhav Bansal: "This innings of Vijay Shankar is painfully reminding me of his struggle against Mustafizur's left arm cutters in the Nidahas final. He was supposed to give strike to Kohli. Instead, him missing balls unnecessarily put pressure on Kohli."

4161~2~11.6
4161~2~4
4161~2~Shankar to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, finds the boundary the other side of that fielder! Shorter and tighter to the body, but Babar caresses it past point, and no chance for the man in the deep. Much, much, much needed boundary for his team

4161~2~3
4161~2~Kuldeep Yadav to Fakhar Zaman, 3 runs, this is more cultured from Fakhar. Steps away, makes some room and cuts past short third man, who has a chase on his hands. Prevents the boundary, but the over ends up going for six

4161~2~Kuldeep Yadav to Babar Azam, OUT, through the gate! Incredible delivery from a supremely talented bowler. Everything about this delivery is the kind of stuff dreams are made of for a left-arm wristspinner. Nicely tossed up, the ball drifts away gently across Babar, pitches and then wickedly spins back in. Babar is looking to get outside the line to block, but is completely deceived by the dip, and then because he's played down the wrong line with a bit of gap between bat and pad, there's no second line of defence. Babar was worried about the wrong'un. Sneaks through the gap, clean bowled. Wow, what a ball. Magnificent.

4161~2~6.52pm Live visuals from Manchester has Kohli chilling in the dressing room. He exudes the body language of someone who knows there's little chance of a resumption. Some of the players have changed into their training gear. Is that a sign?

4161~2~Kartik: "Vijay Shankar's dibbly-dobblies warrant selection for the rest of the WC. Remember exactly how India won the 1983 WC. I see a Madan Lal/Binny/Amarnath element to Vijay Shankar's bowling. " -- I wonder if you've seen a lot of the 1983 film's build up. haha
4161~2~
4161~2~6.45pm Good news, or is it? The covers are coming off. But that doesn't necessarily mean chances of play has brightened. They need time to take the covers off, which I find strange. Sometimes, it's almost as if they've taken longer to peel the covers off than the time play has been held up because of the drizzle.
4161~2~
4161~2~We could be down to a few minutes before a final call. This is all but over. The crowd has thinned, the hover covers are on, it's dark and gloomy overhead.

4161~2~
4161~2~06:35pm The rain has relented somewhat, but the covers remain in place for now. Even if they get them off, it might be hard to get play started before the cut-off time.

4161~2~06:30pm Cut-off time, for those asking, is 19:15, which is 45 minutes from now

4161~2~Abhishek: "Is there any chance for Pakistan, in case rain stops, coz I would have loved seeing a bit of a fight from here on, maybe a Pandyaesque innings to get them near 250-270...would have made things interesting, but other than that, hats off to Men in Blue, a near perfect outing, just hope Bhuvi's Ok, coz, his injury would cause selection headaches, more for his batting at no 8." I don't know what's less likely, the rain relenting or the Pak lower order showing fight from this situation.
4161~2~
4161~2~Hammad Afzal: "What disappointment this turned out to be! From golden age of Pakistan cricket when Pakistan used to be the Asian powerhouse of cricket we have come to a time where India is so far ahead that these two teams simply do not constitute a contest anymore, let alone the greatest rivalry in world cricket!"
4161~2~
4161~2~06:20pm Right, so rain has stopped play, and India will win by 86 runs should play not resume. We will keep you updated, and be back should we have further information.
