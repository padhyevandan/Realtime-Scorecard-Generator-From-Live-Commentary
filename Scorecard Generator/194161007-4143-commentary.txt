4143~1~Imran Tahir to Bairstow, OUT, Tahir strikes! Faf's tactical twist has brought immediate dividends, but it's Bairstow who falls first. He lunges onto the front foot to one that grips and turns just far enough to kiss the outside edge on the way through to de Kock, and Tahir's off in celebration! Head aloft, arms spread wide, and no-one can catch him. Pure joy, and England are 1 for 1!

4143~1~Michael: "If Tahir lands em right legspinners can be very hard to play for new top order batsmen. Could be a masterstroke from the Saffas!" -- The only question is, how many overs do they give him? He's got such an important job to do in the middle overs

4143~1~
4143~1~Seth Miller: "This has to be the most unexpected start to the WC. England lose a wicket second ball, a legspinner bowls the first over and takes a wicket, and Rabada stlil hasn't come on.

SA appeal, and the umpires go upstairs for a TV referral, though the soft signal is 'not out'.

4143~2~Santosh Bhat: "Earlier today, someone called Stokes a dead weight on the English team. Well well well! " Indeed ... and in answer to the question of why he doesn't bowl very much these days, well, two things. One, he is there if needs be but England have options without him. And two, if he's bowling, then England's best fielder is unavailable!

4143~2~Stokes to Rabada, FOUR runs, banged in short, pulled through the leg side and Morgan can't cling on! He stretched high to his left, but did he fully commit?

4143~2~Raghu IFMR: "Rather than go at the target, Amla and Rabada should make sure SA play the full 50 overs. This is a long tournament and NRR will definitely come into play." It's a fair point, but they may not get much say in the matter now

4143~2~Bhargav: "Given SA's bad luck in global tournaments, I have a feeling the NRR difference today will come back to bite them when they come back in contention for top 4 at the end of the league phase." Hold that thought ... we will have ample time to revisit it!

4143~2~Stokes to Rabada, OUT, short again, pulled again, held at deep midwicket again! It's Plunkett this time, stooping forward to cling on in both mitts. That was a solid connection, but the man was well placed and England's fielding has been the most composed aspect of their play today.
